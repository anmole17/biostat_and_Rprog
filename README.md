# Biostat and R prog Notes and codes

This is the collection of all that I have learnt during the Biostatistics and R programming course. 
I will update it with self made LaTeX notes(godspeed) which will include the theory. 
Please point out any improvements. I am learning tidyverse and will try to include the tidyverse style in the code slowly.
